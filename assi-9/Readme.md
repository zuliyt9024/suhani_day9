# Responsive Personal Portfolio (HTML + CSS)

This repository contains a responsive personal portfolio webpage built with **only HTML and CSS**. It meets the assignment requirements: Header, Hero, Skills, and Footer; responsive behavior for desktop / tablet / mobile; and CSS-only hamburger menu.

## Files
- `index.html` — main page
- `style.css` — complete styles and responsive rules
- `README.md` — this file

## Which AI tool I used
> **Tool used:** _REPLACE_WITH_TOOL_NAME_  
(Example: Lovable.dev / Bolt.new / v0.dev / Replit AI / Cursor AI)

> **How I used it:** I generated an initial template using the AI tool, downloaded the boilerplate, and then edited it manually.

## Manual edits I made
- Fixed and rewrote the layout to be fully responsive across multiple breakpoints.
- Implemented a CSS-only hamburger menu using the checkbox hack.
- Added hero card, projects section, and a 6-item skills grid.
- Polished colors, gradients, and subtle hover animations (pure CSS).
- Ensured no horizontal scroll; improved accessibility (focus outlines).
- Created `mailto:` contact buttons and a contact form (opens email client).

> Replace this list with exact file names/lines you changed if required by submission rules.

## Responsive behavior
- **Desktop (≥1024px):** Nav links appear inline.
- **Tablet (768–1023px):** Grid becomes 2-column where appropriate, hero layout adapts.
- **Mobile (≤767px):** Hamburger menu activated; skills and project lists become single-column; no horizontal scroll.

## Bonus points included
- Subtle hover animations on cards and skills.
- Unique color theme with dual accent gradient.
- Card hover lift effects and subtle shadows.

## How to run locally
1. Clone the repo.
2. Open `index.html` in a browser (no build tools required).

## Notes / To do before submission
- Update `README.md` to specify the actual AI tool you used and which parts were edited manually, as required by the assignment.
- Replace `youremail@example.com` with your real contact email.
- Add screenshots (desktop/tablet/mobile) to the repo if you want.

Good luck with the submission — if you want, I can:
- Convert this into a single `index.html` file with embedded CSS,
- Generate ready-made screenshots,
- Or provide a short `git`/README checklist to include in your repo.

Which of those would you like next?
